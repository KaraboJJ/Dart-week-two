# Dart Basics Demo

This Dart program demonstrates fundamental concepts including data types, type conversions, control flow structures, and loops. It also combines these concepts in a practical example to illustrate how they work together in Dart.

## Features

- **Data Types:** Defines and initializes variables of types `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, and `List`.
- **Type Conversion:** Functions to convert between `String`, `int`, and `double`.
- **Conversion Function:** A function `convertAndDisplay` that takes a string representation of a number, converts it to `int` and `double`, and prints the results.
  
- **Control Flow:**
  - Uses `if-else` statements to:
    - Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
    - Determine voting eligibility based on age (18 or older).
  - Uses a `switch` statement to print the day of the week based on an integer input.
    
- **Loops:**
  - `for` loop to print numbers 1 through 10.
  - `while` loop to print numbers 10 through 1.
  - `do-while` loop to print numbers 1 through 5.
    
- **Combined Example:**
  - Iterates through a list of integers.
  - Prints each number.
  - Uses `if-else` to check if the number is even or odd.
  - Uses a `switch` statement with pattern matching to categorize numbers as "small", "medium", or "large".

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the Dart SDK installed. You can download it from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2. Save the Dart code in a file named `data_types_and_control_flow.dart`.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the program with:
   dart run data_types_and_control_flow.dart
